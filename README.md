# Animate.scss
A Scss version of [Dan Eden's](https://github.com/daneden) [Animate.css](http://daneden.me/animate)

## Features
animate-sass has a couple of features to make the most of what Sass has to offer for more effecient development.

### Base Styles
The `_animate.scss` file includes a base sass file that contains the base css rules for animate.scss to work.

### Settings
The settings file defines a range of default [Sass variables](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#variables_) which are used by some of the animation modules. You can override the defaults in your own settings or style sass file(s).

####Animation Module loading
The settings file also sets all animation modules to false (nothing gets loaded).

To include an animation module in your project, simply override the $use[moduleName] variable in your own settings file to true.

By only choosing the animation modules you need, you're keeping the compiled css at it's leanest!

Eg:
````
// These will be included
@import "animation/bounce";
@import "animation/flash";
@import "animation/pulse";
````

Modules are arranged by the following animation types;

- Attention Seekers
- Bouncing Entrances
- Bouncing Exits
- Fading Entrances
- Fading Exits
- Flippers
- Lightspeed
- Rotating Entrances
- Rotating Exits
- Sliding Entrances
- Sliding Exits
- Zoom Entrances
- Zoom Exits
- Specials

### Animations
All individual animation modules are kept in their own [Sass partials](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#partials) so they can be found easily. You shouldn't need to edit these as they are part of the animate.css library.

### Bower Support
Add animate-scss to your project using [Bower](http://bower.io)

bower.json dependency
````
"dependencies": {
  "animate-scss-edition": "1.0.0"
}
````

Command line
`bower install animate-scss-edition`

## Usage
To use animate.scss in your project, you will need to have Sass installed. [Visit the Sass site](http://sass-lang.com/) to find out how to do this.

Once Sass has been installed, you can download or clone this repo into your project's `css` folder and import `animate.scss` into your main Sass stylesheet.

Eg: inside css/style.scss
````
@import "animate-scss/animate"
````

Choose which modules you want to use in you project by overriding the variables set in the `helpers/settings.scss` file in your own settings file.

Add the base css styles mentioned in the BASE section above.

Finally in your markup, simply add the class `animated` to an element, along with any of the animation class names.

````
    <div class="animated fadeIn">
    	<p>Watch me fade in!</p>
    </div>
````

That's it! You've got a CSS animated element. Super!
